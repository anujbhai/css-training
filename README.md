CSS Training for MedSims React Team


Please Note: The app folder contains the react app build along with Emotion JS. While it does not include the 'node_modules' folder, in order to make it light weight, for download and transfer purposes, it is recommended to create a react app in your local directory then add the dependencies according to the 'package.json' file available in the folder.


# Any feedback/questions/comments/suggestions are welcome
In order to make this training more productive, any type of support from the React team members (regarding betterment of conventions and examples used in the project folder and files), will be highly appreciated.
